## About This Site

The Principled Engineer is a software engineering blog. It skews frontend and tends to contain commentary on ethics in tech, developer relationships, and best practices. By nature, it's opinionated.

As the blog takes shape, this section will expand.

## About the Author

My name is Phillip Luther. I go by Phil. I'm the creator of and sole contributor to [The Principled Engineer](https://principled.engineer). Any references to "I" or "me" on this site refer to me, Phillip Luther. Who goes by Phil. And who is the creator of and sole contributor to The Principled Engineer.

Semi-related, bios are hard. Each post has an "About the Author" blurb, though. Those blurbs will have to hold the fort for now and I'll commit to building out this page as the blog grows.

For anything pressing, I can be reached by [email](mailto:hello@principled.engineer).
