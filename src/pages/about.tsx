      <h2>About the Blog</h2>

      <p>
        The Principled Engineer is a blog about building web applications. It
        focuses heavily on modern JavaScript and the associated ecosystems.
        Popular topics include developer experience, engineering culture, and
        the good and ill of industry standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blog often explores ethics and responsibility in application
        engineering, too. That's responsibility to our users â€” making
        responsible and helpful choices for the good of the user, especially
        when those goals might run contrary to the goals of the application.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, consider this a fair warning that things might get finger-waggy
        at times. The Principled Engineer is some dude's personal blog. It's
        editorial, not journalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        And while it make look so, fear not! Not everything on this blog reads
        like Dickens.
      </p>

      <h2>About the Author</h2>

        Semi-related, bios are hard. Each post sports an "About the Author"
        blurb, though. Those'll have to do for now and I'll commit to building
        out this page as the blog grows.
